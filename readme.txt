Overview:
This Project is focused on creating a bankaccount details with 3 functions
1) Creating Bank Accounts with ID and Balance
2) Deposting Money
3) Withdrawing Money
4) Display the info

Steps:
1) I created a Class named BankAccount with 2 constractuors (1st one was taking Account ID and Balance, 2nd was taking Account ID only and give balance 0)
2) I created Withdraw Function and used if Statment with 2 conditions (1st condition to make sure its positive, 2nd condition to make sure its lower than balance)
if both conditions are true it will print, otherwise it will show your balance is not enough
3) I created deposit Function that addes the depositAmount directly to the balance
4) I created a Display Function that displays the account id and balance
